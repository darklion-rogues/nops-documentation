# Using the nOps Cloud UI

nOps Cloud's UI shares many similarities in feature functionality with self-hosted nOps. However, while nOps Cloud is expanding in utility, there may be distinct differences that require users to consult specific product documentation depending on which version of nOps they are using. This docs group contains information on the multiple nOps Cloud pages and dashboards.
