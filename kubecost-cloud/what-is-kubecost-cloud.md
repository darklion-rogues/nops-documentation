# What is nOps Cloud?

nOps Cloud is a SaaS solution that offers easier deployment and more convenient maintenance as an alternative to our on-prem product. You can get started with a free trial [here](http://app.nOps.com/signup).

## Functionality

### What features are currently available?

nOps Cloud will provide you with everything you need in order to visualize your cost spend data and begin saving, with many more features to come soon. nOps Cloud currently supports:

* Cloud integration for AWS, GCP, and Azure billing
* Savings page with container right-sizing, cluster right-sizing, and abandoned workload detection
* SSO via Google, Microsoft, Okta, and GitHub

### What features are coming next?

nOps Cloud's functionality will be quickly expanded. Here's a sneak peek at which features we plan to implement next:

## Is nOps Cloud right for me?

nOps Cloud can help teams oversee cloud spend like our existing product, but there are more reasons this hosted version can be advantageous:

* Simplicity: nOps will handle your upgrades, scaling, and maintenance.
* Cost effective: nOps Cloud will empower users to think big, start small, and scale quickly. Save on team time when you donâ€™t host on-prem.
* Security: We take responsibility for ensuring information on our servers is secure and private.

## Using existing nOps documentation

nOps Cloud brings lots of the same functionality from our existing on-prem product, but there are several distinct differences in their composition that may prevent you from consulting standard nOps documentation for assistance. We do not recommend you consult our other live documentation resources for help, and instead contact us directly at [cloud-support@nOps.com](mailto:cloud-support@nOps.com) with questions. Hyperlinks embedded in this group of docs may take you to live nOps web properties for additional information where relevant.

All information found in this group of docs will be applicable for your installation and experience. Over time, we hope to expand this group to assist with troubleshooting and support.
